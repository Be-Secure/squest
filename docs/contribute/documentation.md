# Contributing to the documentation

The documentation is written in markdown and then generated with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
Required libraries are installed if you've followed the [development environment documentation](../dev/dev-env.md) of the project.

Graphs and diagrams are generated by the [Mermaid library](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).

Update the documentation in the `docs` folder placed in the root of the project.

Run dev server locally to check the result
```bash
mkdocs serve
```

The page is available on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

Send a pull request then to propose your changes to the project.
